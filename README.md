# JGET

JGET is a package manager for CC:Tweaked computers;

This repo contains the server (which is a T3 app) and the CLI for craftOS (jget.lua).

# Missing features:

Versioning - I have no plan to implement this; if you want to version a package, create distinct packages which indicate the version in the name (i.e. gooey-v1, gooey-v2, etc.).
